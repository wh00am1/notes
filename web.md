# Notes About Web Security
## Useful Auditing Tools:
`burpsuite` to capture and modify packets (purchase pro version if you like auto scannning :p)

`nmap ncat` to scan and test ports

`whois` and `theharvester` to collect OSINT data

`python` to create scripts

`sqlmap` to detect and exploit SQL Injection

and of course `F12(Developer tools) in Browser(very useful!)`
### #don't be a script kiddy!!


## Common Vulnerbilities
### XSS(Cross Site Scripting)
### SQL Injection
### CSRF (Cross-Site-Forgery)
